# Bookstore_Inventory_And_Analytics_System

This project is a Python-based Bookstore Inventory and Sales Analytics System developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It simulates real-world bookstore operations such as managing inventory, processing sales, generating reports, and visualizing data for better insights.

# Project Overview

The system is built around a Bookstore class that manages inventory and sales data using Pandas DataFrames. The project combines OOP design with data analysis and visualization to represent bookstore performance in a structured and meaningful way.

# Key OOP Concepts Used

Class & Object (Bookstore class)

Constructor (__init__) for initializing inventory and sales data

Encapsulation of inventory and sales logic

Methods for inventory management, sales processing, and analytics

Abstraction through clearly defined class functions

# Features

Add new books to the inventory

Update stock quantities

Sell books with stock validation

Maintain sales history

Generate inventory and sales reports

Perform basic sales analytics

Visualize inventory and sales data using graphs

# Data Visualization

The project includes visual representations to make data insights easier to understand:

Bar charts to show stock levels of books

Bar charts for total books sold

Visual comparison of inventory before and after sales

These visualizations help identify fast-selling books and low-stock items quickly.

# Tech Stack

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

# How It Works

Inventory and sales data are stored in Pandas DataFrames

A Bookstore object controls all operations

Class methods handle adding, selling, and updating books

Analytics functions compute summaries

Matplotlib is used to visualize inventory and sales trends

# Purpose

This project was developed as a learning-focused academic project to strengthen:

Object-Oriented Programming in Python

Data analysis using Pandas

Data visualization using Matplotlib

Writing clean and maintainable code
